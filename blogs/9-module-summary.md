### GROUP BY

- `GROUP BY` groups rows with the same values in specified columns and lets you apply aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc., to each group.

âœ… **Use Cases for GROUP BY -**

- Total sales per region
- Count of students in each class
- Avg rating per product

### HAVING

- Use `HAVING` to filter grouped results based on aggregate values like totals or counts.

âœ… **Use Cases for HAVING -**

- only show reginons with sales over 10.000
- Classes with more than 30 students
- Products with an average rating above 4.5

### ðŸ§  Summary:

- Use `GROUP BY` when you need to **summarize or categorize data**.
- Use `HAVING` when you want to **filter those categories based on aggregates**.

### ðŸ”¢ SQL Query Execution Order (Serial)

1. **`FROM`** â†’ chooses the source table(s)
2. **`JOIN`** â†’ combines tables (if any joins are used)
3. **`WHERE`** â†’ filters individual rows before grouping
4. **`GROUP BY`** â†’ groups rows with the same values
5. **`HAVING`** â†’ filters grouped data (uses aggregate conditions)
6. **`SELECT`** â†’ picks the columns or aggregates to show
7. **`ORDER BY`** â†’ sorts the final result
8. **`LIMIT`** â†’ restricts number of rows returned

### Foreign Key vs Primary key

- âœ… **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table (no duplicates, no nulls).
- ðŸ”— **Foreign Key**: Connects one table to another by referencing the primary key of another table.

### Joins

| **JOIN Type** | **What It Does** |
| --- | --- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns **only matching** rows from both tables. |
| **LEFT JOIN** | All rows from **left table** + matching from right. |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All rows from **right table** + matching from left. |
| **FULL JOIN** | **All rows** from both tables (match or not). |
| **CROSS JOIN** | **All combinations** (cartesian product) of both tables. |
| **NATURAL JOIN** | Auto-joins tables using **common column(s)** by name. |
